// Timer value needs to restore on page refresh or window reopen

//save timer value in local storage.
// create an object each counter variable on every interval.
// push object into localArray
// save to local storage on every interval.


// Functionality needed to enter a custom time

// created input fields for each counter variable and set a range
// update timer on click
// push to localArray and save in local storage


// create functionality to delete all stamps from local storage


// fix bugs

// play button can be clicked multiple times which starts a new interval
// delete modal doesnt show after generating a new stamp.
